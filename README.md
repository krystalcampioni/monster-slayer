# Monster Slayer

> A little Vue.js game prototype. The idea of this project was to expand on the Monster Slayer project created by Maximilian Schwarzmüller on his [VueJs2 The Complete Guide Course ](http://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide), and see how further we could push the limits of the interface using Vue components, transitions and CSS animations.
